CREATE DATABASE
---------------

@- Syntax...

   CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;



CREATE TABLE
------------

@- Syntax...

   CREATE TABLE <table_name>(
   	<column_name1> <data_type1> (size),
   	<column_name2> <data_type2> (size),
   	<column_nameN> <data_typeN> (size)
);



SELECT
------

@- SELECT statement is used to... 

   Get data from a table.

@- SELECT syntax...

   SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ...<columnN>
   FROM <table_name>;

   FROM <table_name>;

@- SELECT DISTINCT works with ___ columns.

   With only one column



SELECT TOP
----------

@- SELECT TOP is used to...

   Return desired number of rows from a table.

@- SELECT TOP is a ___

   Clause.

@- Syntax...

   SELECT TOP number/percent <column_name1>, <column_name2>, ... , <column_nameN>
   FROM <table_name>;

@- Syntax using percent...

   SELECT TOP 50 percent <column_name1>, <column_name2>, ... , <column_nameN>
   FROM <table_name>;

@- Syntax... MySQL

   SELECT <column_name1>, <column_name2>, ... , <column_nameN>
   FROM <table_name>
   LIMIT <number>;

@- Syntax... Oracle

   SELECT <column_name1>, <column_name2>, ... , <column_nameN>
   FROM <table_name>
   WHERE ROWNUM <= <number>;



WHERE 
-----

@- SQL WHERE is a ___

   Clause

@- When do we use WHERE clause?

   We use WHERE clause to extract data according to our given criterion.

@- WHERE syntax...

   SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ...<columnN>
   FROM <table_name>
   WHERE <column_name> <operator> <value>;

@- Which operators we use with WHERE clause...

   = (equal)
   <> (not equal)
   > (greater than)
   >= (greater than or equal)
   < (smaller than)
   <= (smaller than or equal)
   LIKE
   BETWEEN
   IN



LIKE
----

@- 'LIKE'

   SQL LIKE operator is used with WHERE clause to search for a specified patern in a column.

@- Syntax...

   SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ...<columnN>
   FROM <table_name>
   WHERE <column_name> LIKE <patern>;

@- 'NOT LIKE'

   NOT LIKE operator is used to find something from a column which is not like the defined pattern.

@- Syntax...

   SELECT <column1>, <column2>, ...<columnN>
   FROM <table_name>
   WHERE <column_name> NOT LIKE <pattern>;

@- 'BETWEEN'

@- 'IN'

   IN operator is used to find multiple values from a table.

@- Syntax...

   SELECT <column1>,<column2>,....<columnN>
   FROM <table_name>
   WHERE <column_name> IN <value1, value2, valueN>;



DELETE
------

@- DELETE statment is used to...

   Delete records from a table.

@- Syntax...

   DELETE FROM <table_name>
   WHERE <some_column> = <some_value>;

@- If we use DELETE statement without WHERE clause what will happen?

   It will delete all the records from a table.

@- If we delete all the records from a table use DELETE statement will rest other still remain?

   Yes table structure, index, attributes etc. will still remain as before. Just the records will be truncated.

@- Delete all records from a table...

   DELETE FROM <table_name>;
   
   or

   DELETE * FROM <table_name>;



ORDER BY
--------

@- SQL ORDER BY is a ___

   Clause

@- ORDER BY clause is used to...

   To sort the result set.

@- Default sorting order is...

   Ascending(ASC)

@- Syntax...

   SELECT <column_name1>, <column_name2>,...,<column_nameN>
   FROM <table_name>
   ORDER BY <column_name1> <ASC/DESC>, <column_name2> <ASC/DESC>, <column_nameN> <ASC/DESC>;

@- Explain how multiple columns sorting works? 

   At first SQL engine sorts column 1 according to the given ascending order than it looks for same value in column 1. If it finds then it sorts the column 2 depending for the same values of column 1. And this process works for N number of columns.



INSERT INTO
-----------

@- INSERT INTO statement is used to...

   Insert records into table.

@- Syntax 1 ...

   INSERT INTO <table_name>
   VALUES (value1, value2, ... , <valueN>);

@- Syntax 2 ...

   INSERT INTO <table_name> (<column_name1>, <column_name2>, ... , <column_nameN>)
   VALUE (value1, value2, ... , valueN);

@- Insert multiple records with one single querry...

   INSERT INTO <table_name>
   (<column_name1>, <column_name2, ... , <column_nameN>)
   VALUES (value1, value2, ... , valueN), (value1, value2, ... , valueN), (value1, value2, ... , valueN)

UPDATE
------

@- Why we use SQL UPDATE statement...

   We use SQL UPDATE to update cells of an existing table.

@- Syntax...

   UPDATE <table_name>
   SET <column_name1> = <value1>, <column_name2> = <value2>, <column_nameN> = <valueN>;
   WHERE <column_name> = <value>;

@- Why do we need to use WHERE clause with UPDATE statement?

   We need to use WHERE clause with UPDATE statement to identify which specific cell we are going to update. An Update statemtn without WHERE will actually update all the cells of field with new given value.



ALTER TABLE
-----------

@- Why do we use ALTER TABLE statement?

   To add, drop or modify columns of an existing table.

@- To add a single column within a table...

   ALTER TABLE <table_name>
   ADD COLUMN <column_name> <data_type>;

@- To add multiple columns to a table...

   ALTER TABLE <table_name>
   ADD COLUMN <column_name1> <data_type>
   ADD COLUMN <column_name2> <data_type>
   ADD COLUMN <column_nameN> <data_type>;

@- To delete a single column of a table...

   ALTER TABlE <table_name>
   DROP COLUMN <column_name>;

@- To delete multiple columns of a table...

   ALTER TABLE <table_name>
   DROP COLUMN <column_name1>, <column_name2>,.....,<column_nameN>;

@- Some databases don't allow ___ columns.

   Some databases don't allow deleting columns.

@- To change data type of a column - Oracle

   ALTER TABLE <table_name>
   MODIFY <column_name> <data_type>;

@- To change data type of a column - MY Sql

   ALTER TABLE <table_name>
   MODIFY COLUMN <column_name> <data_type>;

@- To change data type of a column - MS Excess/SQL server

   ALTER TABLE <table_name>
   ALTER COLUMN <column_name> <data_type>;

@- Why we use TRUNCAT TABLE statement?

   To delete all data of a table while preserving the original table structure.

@- Syntax...

   TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>;

Questions-
- SELECT DISTINCT only work with one column? If yes: pass if not: update SELECT DISTINCT block
